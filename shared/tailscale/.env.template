# --- Other Tailscale Settings ---
# Additional Tailscale settings (TS_EXTRA_ARGS, TS_HOSTNAME, etc.) are pre-configured
# in the shared/tailscale/docker-compose.yml file.
# You typically do not need to override them here unless you have specific needs
# and modify the docker-compose.yml to not set them directly.
