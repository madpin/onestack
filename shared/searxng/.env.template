# shared/searxng/.env.template
# Copy this file to shared/searxng/.env to define SearXNG specific variables.
# Note: The shared/searxng/docker-compose.yml currently sets environment variables
# directly. To use this .env file, you would need to add `env_file: .env`
# to the searxng service definition in its docker-compose.yml.

# --- SearXNG Security ---
# CRITICAL: A long, random secret key used by SearXNG for security purposes (e.g., cookie signing).
# Generate a strong one using: openssl rand -hex 32
SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY=your_very_strong_random_searxng_secret_key_here

# --- SearXNG Base URL (Optional Override) ---
# The public URL where SearXNG will be accessible.
# This is set in docker-compose.yml by default using the global BASE_DOMAIN:
# DEFAULT_BASE_URL=https://searxng.${BASE_DOMAIN}/
# You can override it here if using this .env file with the env_file directive.
# Ensure it includes the scheme (http/https) and a trailing slash.
# BASE_URL=https://my-custom-searxng-url.com/

# --- SearXNG Configuration ---
# Most SearXNG settings (enabled engines, result formatting, theming, etc.)
# are configured in the `settings.yml` file located in `shared/searxng/config/`.
# This .env.template is primarily for secrets or fundamental URL settings.

# For a full list of SearXNG environment variables and configuration options,
# refer to the official SearXNG documentation: https://docs.searxng.org/admin/settings.html
