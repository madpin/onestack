# shared/mongodb/.env.template
# This file documents variables relevant to the MongoDB service.
# Core credentials (root user/password, app user/password) are typically set
# in the project's root .env file and used by shared/mongodb/docker-compose.yml.
#
# To use variables from a shared/mongodb/.env file to override docker-compose.yml settings,
# you would need to uncomment `env_file: .env` in shared/mongodb/docker-compose.yml.

# --- MongoDB Initialization Script Variables ---
# The following variables are used by the mongo-init/*.js script if defined
# in the environment when the MongoDB container initializes.
# Currently, LIBRECHAT_DB and MADPIN_DB are hardcoded in docker-compose.yml's environment section.
# Defining them here would only take effect if docker-compose.yml's env_file directive for '.env' is active
# AND these are removed from the docker-compose.yml environment section.

# Example database names that the init script can create and grant access to:
# LIBRECHAT_DB=librechat_prod
# MADPIN_DB=madpin_dev
# ANOTHER_APP_DB=another_database

# --- Standard MongoDB Docker Image Variables ---
# Specifies the database to use for initial authentication of MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
# and where initialization scripts are run. Defaults to 'test' if not set, 'admin' is common.
# MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=admin

# --- Informational: Variables from root .env used by docker-compose.yml ---
# These are typically set in the project's root .env file:
# MONGODB_ROOT_USER=root
# MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_strong_mongodb_root_password_here
# MONGODB_USER=appuser
# MONGODB_PASSWORD=your_strong_mongodb_app_password_here
# MONGODB_PORT=27017 (Host exposure port)

# To add more databases or change user permissions for the APP_USER:
# - Modify the script(s) in `shared/mongodb/mongo-init/`.
# - If initialization has already run, changes to init scripts won't automatically apply
#   without clearing the MongoDB data volume (which erases all data).
#   Alternatively, connect as root and make changes manually.

# For a full list of MongoDB Docker image environment variables, see:
