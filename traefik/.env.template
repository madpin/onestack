# traefik/.env.template
# Copy this file to traefik/.env ONLY if you need to set Traefik-specific
# variables that are NOT intended to be in the global root .env file.
#
# Most Traefik configuration variables (BASE_DOMAIN, ACME_EMAIL, DASHBOARD_AUTH, etc.)
# are typically defined in the project's root .env file and are directly substituted
# into traefik/docker-compose.yml.

# --- Traefik Dashboard Authentication ---
# Credentials for accessing the Traefik dashboard.
# This variable (DASHBOARD_AUTH) should ideally be set in the project's root .env file.
#
# To generate the value:
# 1. Use htpasswd: `htpasswd -nb your_username "your_strong_password"`
#    (Install htpasswd if not available, e.g., `sudo apt-get install apache2-utils`)
# 2. The output will be like: `your_username:$apr1$....`
# 3. In the .env file, ensure the value is enclosed in SINGLE QUOTES if it contains dollar signs,
#    to prevent shell misinterpretation:
#    DASHBOARD_AUTH='your_username:$apr1$....your_hashed_password_here....'
#
# Example placeholder (generate your own):
# DASHBOARD_AUTH='admin:$apr1$abcdefg$hijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345'

# --- Informational: Variables from root .env used by Traefik's docker-compose.yml ---
# These are expected to be set in the project's root .env file:
#
# BASE_DOMAIN=your.domain.com  # Base domain for Traefik and services
# ACME_EMAIL=your-email@example.com # Email for Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
# WEB_NETWORK_NAME=web # Docker network Traefik monitors
# TRAEFIK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG # Traefik's log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)

# For a full list of Traefik configuration options (static and dynamic),
# refer to the official Traefik documentation: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/
