# ttrss/.env.template
# This file documents variables relevant to the Tiny Tiny RSS (TTRSS) service.
# Many of these variables are expected to be set in the project's root .env file,
# as ttrss/docker-compose.yml substitutes them directly.
#
# This service's docker-compose.yml does not currently load a service-specific .env file.
# To use variables from a ttrss/.env file to override docker-compose.yml settings,
# you would need to add `env_file: .env` to its docker-compose.yml service definition.

# --- TTRSS Initial User Configuration ---
# These are used to create an initial user account when TTRSS first starts.
# Set these in your project's root .env file.
AUTO_CREATE_USER=your_ttrss_admin_username # Choose a username for the first TTRSS admin user
AUTO_CREATE_USER_PASS=your_strong_ttrss_password_here # Choose a strong password for this user

# --- TTRSS Database Configuration ---
# Name of the PostgreSQL database for TTRSS.
# Set this in your project's root .env file.
POSTGRES_TTRSS_DB=ttrss_db # Example: ttrss_db or tt_rss

# The following PostgreSQL connection details are also expected in the root .env file:
# POSTGRES_USER
# POSTGRES_PASSWORD
# POSTGRES_HOST
# POSTGRES_PORT

# --- TTRSS URL Configuration ---
# TTRSS_SELF_URL_PATH is constructed in docker-compose.yml using the global BASE_DOMAIN.
# Example (from docker-compose.yml): TTRSS_SELF_URL_PATH=https://ttrss.${BASE_DOMAIN}
# Ensure BASE_DOMAIN is set correctly in the root .env file.

# --- File Ownership ---
# UID and GID for file permissions on TTRSS data volumes.
# These are taken from the global UID and GID in the root .env file.
# UID=1000
# GID=1000

# --- Optional: TTRSS HTTP Port ---
# If the TTRSS Docker image serves content on a port other than 80 (e.g., 8280),
# you might need to set HTTP_PORT. The current ttrss/docker-compose.yml does not
# explicitly set this, assuming a default (likely port 80) for Traefik integration.
# If you uncomment and set this, also ensure the Traefik service port label is updated.
# HTTP_PORT=8280

# Note:
# - TTRSS behavior, plugins, and themes are further configured within the TTRSS web interface
#   or via PHP configuration files in `ttrss/config/`.
# - For a full list of TTRSS environment variables supported by the specific Docker image
#   (`nventiveux/ttrss:latest`), refer to its documentation on Docker Hub or GitHub.
