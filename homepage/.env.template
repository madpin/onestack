# homepage/.env.template
# This file documents variables relevant to the Homepage service.
# Values are typically inherited from the root .env file or set directly
# in homepage/docker-compose.yml.

# --- Informational: Variables used from root .env ---
# The PUID and PGID for Homepage are taken from the global UID and GID settings
# in the project's root .env file.
# UID=1000
# GID=1000

# --- Informational: Variables set in docker-compose.yml ---
# HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS is configured in homepage/docker-compose.yml
# using the global BASE_DOMAIN variable:
# DEFAULT_HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=homepage.${BASE_DOMAIN}

# --- Optional: Overriding HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS ---
# To override the default HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS, you would need to:
# 1. Add `env_file: .env` to the homepage service in homepage/docker-compose.yml.
# 2. Create a homepage/.env file.
# 3. Define HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS in that homepage/.env file.
#
# Example for overriding if using a local .env:
# HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=dashboard.mycustomdomain.com,another.host.org

# Homepage configuration (bookmarks, widgets, etc.) is done via YAML files
# in the homepage/config/ directory. No environment variables are typically
# needed here for that aspect of its setup.
